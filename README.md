# User-tracker

User tracker is a web application designed to trace the activities of our user. This will help us to analyze how the user reacts to the front-
end design and what difficulties the user is facing in accessing the parts of the website.

There is an image which acts as a user's cursor and is assigned the co-ordinates of the real cursor as it was moved by the user. The 
click events are triggered with the help of jquery. Right now only two primary events (mousemove and mouseclick) is recorded in the windows
element of the user.

You click the button "Replay" which will replay your actions and refreshes the page after one second or so.

The project is still in its primitive form and any contribution would be appreciated. You can view the demo at
